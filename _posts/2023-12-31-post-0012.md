# How to enroll a macOS device to Intune MDM?

In this post i will show you how you can onboard Apple macOS devices through the Microsoft Company portal to Microsoft Intune. With this onboarding you can push configurations and/or applications from Microsoft Intune to macOS devices or use Compliance policies to grant or deny access over Azure AD conditional access.

1. So lets begin with downloading the Company portal app from the Microsoft website. Use this link: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853070

If you like you can delete the Installer files as we do not need them anymore.
