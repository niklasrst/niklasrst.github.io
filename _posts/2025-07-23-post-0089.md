# What is the myapps portal?
[MyApps](https://myapps.microsoft.com) is Microsofts web-based portal that provides users with a centralized location to access all their work or school applications, services, and resources. It’s part of Entra ID and simplifies access to cloud apps like Microsoft 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and many more by supporting single sign-on (SSO). Users can also manage their account settings, security info, and device registrations—all in one place. This can be the "one-stop-shop" for your users to access their cloud apps.

# Why would I want to add more apps there?
Adding more applications, including 3rd party apps, to [MyApps](https://myapps.microsoft.com) enhances the user experience, strengthens security, and simplifies IT management. Here’s why it makes sense:

### Centralized Access for Users
By consolidating all key apps—Microsoft and 3rd party—into a single portal, users no longer need to remember multiple URLs or credentials. This improves efficiency and reduces friction in daily workflows.

### Improved Security with Single Sign-On (SSO)
Integrating apps into Entra ID enables secure single sign-on. Users authenticate once and gain access to all connected apps, reducing the risk of password fatigue and weak password reuse.

### Streamlined Onboarding and Offboarding
With apps managed through Entra ID, access can be granted or revoked centrally based on role or group membership. This ensures users have what they need—and only what they need—right from day one, and that access is cleanly removed when they leave.

### Conditional Access and MFA Enforcement
By routing app access through Entra ID, organizations can enforce conditional access policies and multifactor authentication, even for 3rd party apps—raising the security baseline across the board.

### User Self-Service Capabilities
The portal enables users to reset passwords, register security info, and even request access to applications, reducing helpdesk load and improving response times. Adding more apps to MyApps isn’t just about convenience—it’s a strategic move that improves user productivity, centralizes control, and enhances security posture across your digital workplace.

# How to add apps?

Follow these simple steps to add your own apps to [MyApps](https://myapps.microsoft.com) and control which uses get those new apps with Entra ID group memberships.

To get started, open the [Entra admin center]() and click on `Enterprise apps`: <br>

Now lets create a new application: <br>

As we want to create a new weblink, we need to choose `+ Create your own application` <br>

![](/images/0089/03.png)

Define a name (like for example for my `Azure DevBox` app) and select `Integrate any other application you dont find in the gallery (Non-gallery)`: <br>

Switch to `Properties` inside of the new Enterprise app and set `Assignment required?` to `NO`. Then save the app. <br>

Now click on `App registrations` in the left menu of the Entra portal, choose `All applications` and search for your newly created app. Click on it: <br>

Switch to `Branding & properties` to define a logo and the url of the app itself (like here the devportal url). Then click on Save: <br>

Now click on `Enterprise apps` in the left menu of the Entra portal, choose `All applications` and search for your newly created app. Click on it: <br>

We need to modify the `Single sing-on` property to the type `Linked`: <br>

Then define the URL where we need to sign-on to this application. In my example its the same as the `Homepage URL` was: <br>

Lastly we just need to assign the app to a Entra group to define and control which users will see this new app. Simply click on `+ Add user/group` and assign a user or a group. Using a group simplyfies the management and you could include it in internal processes for automation: <br>

# How does it looks for the user?

Once youve finished all the above steps, a user which is assigned to the app will see the new link in his [MyApps Portal](https://myapps.microsoft.com): <br>

Clicking on the link will open a new browser tab with the defined url for this app. In this case it would be https://devportal.microsoft.com/ but it could be any url that youve defined in the Entra app. <br>

# Conclusion

Adding custom or 3rd party applications to MyApps provides a consistent, secure, and user-friendly experience for your organization. It centralizes access to all essential tools—regardless of vendor—making it easier for users to find and use the apps they need. In short, integrating more apps into MyApps boosts productivity, strengthens security, and simplifies the users day-to-day life. In my opinion this is a great and simple way to provide your endusers the right urls for the apps that they need to use and its a save-place for them to start using cloud apps -  without unsafe google searches for some cloud apps urls.
