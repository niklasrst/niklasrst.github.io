# How to change the Windows display language through Intune?

If you need to be able to change the system language of Windows clients via Microsoft Intune, you can do this using an Intune configuration profile. This can be the case, for example, if you have set up all of the company’s clients in English and then added them to Intune via autopilot, but there are users in the company who need a different display language.

In order to be able to implement this requirement, we first have to provide the respective Local Experience Pack (LEP) as a managed app in Intune. For this we can use the Windows Store as a source or in the future the WinGet package manager. In this example, I deployed the LEP from the Windows Store:

We assign this application to the clients on which we want to change the display language. The installation is carried out in the background without user interaction. In order to activate the installed LEP, we need an additional configuration profile.

To do this, we select „Settings Catalog“ as the type and then configure the display language for all logged-in users:

The desired language can be selected via the drop-down menu:

Optionally, it makes sense to activate the item „Allow Language“ so that users can then adapt or change the language pack, for example to be able to choose other keyboard layouts:

After the LEP and configuration profile are assigned and installed on the client, the client needs to be restarted once. With the restart, the system language changes, this change is already visible on the login screen, since the user name and password are then already displayed in the selected language.
