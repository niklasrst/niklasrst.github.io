# Upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 with Microsoft Intune

Upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11 for an enterprise can be a challenging task. Microsoft Intune, a cloud-based service that manages devices and applications, can simplify the upgrade process. In this post, we’ll cover the necessary steps to take when upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11 using Microsoft Intune.

## Check Your System Requirements
Before you start the upgrade process, you need to ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for Windows 11. Microsoft has set some new requirements, such as support for TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, which might not be available on older systems.

To check if your system meets the requirements, you can use Microsoft’s PC Health Check app, which is available for download from the Microsoft Store.

## Plan Your Upgrade Strategy
Once you’ve confirmed that your systems meet the requirements for Windows 11, you need to plan your upgrade strategy. You should consider factors such as the number of devices, the time required for the upgrade, and the availability of resources.

You can also create a pilot group to test the upgrade process before rolling it out to all devices. This helps you identify and address any issues before they impact your entire organization.

## Prepare Your Devices for Upgrade
Before you can upgrade your devices, you need to prepare them for the upgrade. This includes updating your existing Windows 10 devices with the latest Windows 10 updates, drivers, and firmware. You should also ensure that your devices meet any additional hardware requirements for Windows 11.

You can use Microsoft Intune to deploy updates, drivers, and firmware to your devices. Microsoft Intune also allows you to create device configuration profiles that can configure settings on your devices to meet the requirements for Windows 11.

## Create an Upgrade Profile
After you’ve prepared your devices for the upgrade, you need to create an upgrade profile. This profile contains the configuration settings required for the upgrade process, such as the installation source and installation options.

You can create an upgrade profile using Microsoft Intune’s Windows 10 Upgrade Readiness feature. This feature assesses your devices and creates an upgrade plan based on your organization’s requirements.

## Deploy Windows 11 Upgrade
Once you’ve created your upgrade profile, you can deploy the Windows 11 upgrade to your devices using Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Intune allows you to schedule the upgrade process, so you can minimize disruption to your users.

You can also monitor the upgrade process using Microsoft Intune’s reporting capabilities. This allows you to track the progress of the upgrade and identify any issues that may arise.

## Conclusion
Upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11 using Microsoft Intune can simplify the upgrade process for enterprises. By following these steps, you can ensure that your devices meet the requirements for Windows 11 and that your upgrade process is successful.
