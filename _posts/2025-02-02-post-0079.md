# Managing Local Windows Groups through Intune Account Protection Policies

In an enterprise environment, managing local Windows groups such as `Administrators` 
and `Remote Desktop Users` is critical for ensuring secure access to systems. Intune, 
Microsoft's mobile device management (MDM) platform, offers powerful Account Protection 
policies that can help administrators enforce security settings for these groups. 
By leveraging Intune’s capabilities, organizations can standardize access control, 
minimize security risks, and ensure compliance across devices.

## What are Account Protection Policies?

Account Protection policies in Microsoft Intune allow administrators to configure security 
settings for user accounts, including those tied to local Windows groups. These policies are 
particularly useful in managing who has elevated privileges and remote access permissions, 
such as users in the `Administrators` or `Remote Desktop Users` groups.

## Managing Local Groups with Intune

Here’s how Intune can help manage local Windows groups effectively. For this example we 
will configure the local `Administrators` group to prevent privileged users to manipulate this group.

First we need to open the [Intune portal](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_Workflows/SecurityManagementMenu/~/accountprotection) 
and navigate to the Endpoint protection blade, right into the `Account protection` view.

Here create a new policy:

The policy needs to be from the `Local user group membership` type:

Define a `Name` and `Description` as you like:

Now click on `+ Add` and choose one of the well-known local groups from Windows. 
Here we will configure the `Administrators` group. If you want you can check multiple groups but for a simpler
management I would recommend to split them up.

You can choose between 
- `Add (Update)` 
    - this option simply adds users to the group.
- `Remove (Update)`
    - this option can be used to remove users from the group as they will not be removed if you delete them from an Add (Update) policy.
- `Add (Replace)`
    - this is the most secure as it fixes the members and if somehow anyone is added, with the next sync the group will be back in the configured state from this policy.

Now of course we need to define users. Here we habe the option to pick `Users/Groups` with a simple picker from Entra ID. 
Or a `Manual` mode. I would preferr the Manual mode as this is the only option to also add the local Administrator account build-in to Windows.
If you want to use Windows Laps then you defenitely want to add this account and ensure that it is in the local Administrators group.

For this example we will choose `Manual` for the above described usecase.

In `Manual` mode you can add `[local] Usernames`, `[entraId or AD] Domain/Username` and `SID` to a group policy.
There is a nice tool available [HERE](https://erikengberg.com/azure-ad-object-id-to-sid/) to convert Entra ID Object IDs 
from groups to SIDs. Which you need to add Entra ID groups.

This example policy has the SID from an Entra ID group, followed by an Entra ID user and the local Administrator account.

## Benefits

- **Centralized Management**: Admins can manage user access to critical groups directly through Intune, reducing the need for manual interventions on individual devices.
- **Security and Compliance**: Automating and enforcing these settings ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive systems, helping organizations stay compliant with security standards.
- **Efficient Remediation**: Quick remediation and audit capabilities reduce the risk of errors and help maintain security hygiene across the organization.

# Conclusion

Using Intune to manage local Windows groups like "Administrators" and "Remote Desktop Users" simplifies administrative overhead 
and strengthens security in an enterprise environment. By setting clear Account Protection policies, organizations can ensure that
only authorized users have elevated privileges or remote access, reducing the risk of security breaches.
