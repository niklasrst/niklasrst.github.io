# How to manually trigger Intune remediations on Windows devices?

In the dynamic realm of Modern Work Solutions, ensuring the security and compliance of our devices is paramount. Microsoft Intune stands as a stalwart guardian, orchestrating the symphony of security measures for Windows devices. Today, we delve into the world of Intune Remediations – those proactive actions that keep your devices in check. Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of manual triggers, let’s take a moment to understand the significance of remediations in fortifying our digital landscapes.

## Understanding Intune Remediations
Remediations, in the context of Microsoft Intune, are preemptive measures aimed at resolving security, configuration and compliance issues on Windows devices. They serve as the frontline defense, ensuring that your fleet of devices remains resilient against potential threats. While Intune automates most of these actions, there are scenarios where a manual trigger becomes essential – be it for troubleshooting or responding to an immediate security concern.

## Manually Triggering Remediations: A Step-by-Step Guide
Navigate to the Intune Portal: Log in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center and select „Devices“ from the left-hand menu and then pick „Windows“.

In the list of your devices pick the one where you want to run the remediation:

Now click on the 3-dots in the top menu, if the option „Run remediation“ is not visible yet. Then click on „Run remediation“:

Now select the remediation that you want to be run manually from the list. As you can see in my example I am going to trigger the „Windows Client Reboot Notification“ manually on this device:

Once you´ve clicked on „Run remediation“ Intune will tell the device to run the remediation immediately and confirm it with a notification in the portal:
