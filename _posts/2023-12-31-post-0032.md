# A quick tip for troubleshooting IME

As IT professionals dedicated to enhancing the modern workplace with Microsoft Intune, we’re all about streamlining processes, ensuring seamless deployments, and, most importantly, keeping an eye on every facet of our operations. Today, I’m here to share a quick tip that could significantly enhance your troubleshooting and diagnostic capabilities. It’s all about the Intune Logs folder at `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs.` This often-overlooked directory can become your best friend when it comes to monitoring and debugging your Intune packages and scripts.

## Recommendation for Every Intune Admin
If you’re a Microsoft Intune admin, I strongly recommend making this folder your default choice for storing logs related to your packages and scripts. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide on how to do it:

When creating a package or script deployment, ensure that you specify the log directory as `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs` or the equivalent path for your specific scenario.

Always use descriptive file names that clearly indicate the purpose and context of the log.

You can easily add this folder to the PSAppDeployToolKit by editing the file `AppDeployToolkit/AppDeployToolkitConfig.xml`.

Change the path for exe files:
