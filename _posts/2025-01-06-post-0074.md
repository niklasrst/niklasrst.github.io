# Configuring Bitlocker for Windows devices using a Settings catalog profile in Intune

In an increasingly interconnected world, data security is paramount. Microsoft BitLocker, a robust encryption solution, plays a crucial role in protecting sensitive information on Windows devices. Whether you’re a business professional, a student, or a home user, understanding BitLocker’s capabilities and benefits is essential.

Let’s delve into the configuration of BitLocker using an Intune settings catalog configuration.

## What Is Microsoft BitLocker?
BitLocker is a full-disk encryption feature available in Windows 11 (as well as Windows 10). It encrypts entire drives, including the operating system, system files, and user data. Here’s what you need to know:

- Automatic Activation: On supported devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education, BitLocker activates automatically when you sign in with your Microsoft account. For local accounts, you can manually enable BitLocker using the BitLocker management tool.
- Enhanced Security: BitLocker protects your data by encrypting it at rest. Even if someone gains physical access to your device or removes the hard drive, they won’t be able to access your files without the decryption key.
- Recovery Key: It’s crucial to back up your BitLocker recovery key. If BitLocker detects unauthorized access attempts, it will prompt you for this key. Without it, you won’t be able to access your drive. Safeguarding this key is essential.

## Settings catalog configuration
To configure Bitlocker from the Settings catalog within Microsoft Intune we need to define a few settings. Lets start with the base settings from the „BitLocker“ section:

Next we need to configure the „Operating System Drives“ from the „Windows Components“ section where we will find the next few configurations:

Now simply assign the profile to your device group and this should encrypt drives using Bitlocker – this also works during Windows Autopilot.

## Conclusion
Microsoft BitLocker is more than just encryption; it’s peace of mind. By enabling BitLocker on your Windows 11 device, you fortify your data against threats and vulnerabilities. Remember to secure your recovery key and embrace the power of encryption.

### Why BitLocker Matters
- Data Protection and Privacy
    - BitLocker ensures that your sensitive files, documents, and personal information remain confidential. Whether it’s financial records, intellectual property, or personal photos, encryption shields them from unauthorized eyes.
    - Many industries and organizations must comply with data protection regulations. BitLocker helps meet these requirements by securing data at rest, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- Business Continuity
    - In case of device loss or theft, BitLocker prevents unauthorized access. Your data remains safe, and you can focus on recovering or replacing the device without worrying about data exposure.
- Ease of Use
    - BitLocker integrates seamlessly with Windows, requiring minimal user intervention. Once activated, it works silently in the background, ensuring continuous protection.
