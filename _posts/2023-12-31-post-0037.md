# Implementing apps evergreen mode with Winget

In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, keeping your software up-to-date is crucial for security, performance, and user experience. Evergreen app management is an approach that ensures your applications are continuously updated, providing benefits such as enhanced security, improved functionality, and reduced technical debt.

## What is Evergreen App Management?
Evergreen app management refers to the practice of maintaining applications in a perpetual state of freshness. Unlike traditional approaches where software updates are sporadic and disruptive, Evergreen IT embraces a continuous improvement model.

Here are some key aspects of Evergreen app management:

- Frequent Updates: Evergreen IT involves regular, incremental updates rather than large-scale migrations. For example, Windows 10 and Office 365 receive biannual feature updates. These smaller, more frequent updates reduce the impact on end-users and IT teams.
- Automated Deployment: Tools like Microsoft Intune automate application deployment, ensuring that the latest versions are pushed to devices seamlessly. This eliminates manual intervention and reduces the risk of human error.
- Security Enhancements: Evergreen app management prioritizes security patches and bug fixes. By promptly applying updates, organizations can protect against vulnerabilities and minimize the risk of cyberattacks.
- User Experience: Up-to-date applications provide a better user experience. Features are enhanced, and compatibility issues are addressed promptly, leading to increased productivity and satisfaction.

## Why Evergreen App Management Matters
- Security: Cyber threats evolve rapidly. Evergreen app management ensures that security patches are applied promptly, reducing the attack surface and safeguarding sensitive data.
- Compliance: Regulatory requirements demand up-to-date software. Evergreen IT helps organizations stay compliant by ensuring that applications meet the latest standards.
- Productivity: Outdated software can hinder productivity. Evergreen app management keeps applications optimized, minimizing disruptions and downtime.
- Cost Efficiency: Traditional migrations are costly and time-consuming. Evergreen IT avoids large-scale projects, saving resources and reducing operational expenses.
- Competitive Edge: Organizations that embrace Evergreen app management can respond faster to market changes, gaining a competitive advantage.

## Implementing Evergreen using WinGet for Intune managed Endpoints
That is where the Winget-AutoUpdate-aaS app from Hauke Hasselberg comes in. This great tool runs automatically in the background and scans within defined parameters for available updates which then will be applied to automatically patch your apps. And the best point is that it can be managed by Intune using the app and ADMX templates provided by the developer.

Firstly lets import the app to our Intune environment from https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP89BSK82W9J28?hl=de-DE&gl=CI:

Next we need to import the ADMX Templates from https://github.com/Weatherlights/Winget-AutoUpdate-Intune/tree/main/ADMX:

The last step is to create a „Imported Administrative Template“ configuration profile an define the parameters for our environment for the Winget-AutoUpdate-aaS app. There are a few:

I like to have it update on a daily base, so I enabled this setting:

Also I would like the app to check on a user logon if there are updates and process them directly:

A optionaly option is to create a Startmenu (or Desktop if you dont have a Clear-Desktop policy) shortcut to be able to scan on demand:

Of course there are more options but in my case I only configured those. You also could work with lists to define which apps should be included into auto-update or which should be excluded. But thats depending on the case and environment.

When an update is applied the user will see that notification:
