# Inform users of newly enrolled devices with Enrollment notifications from Microsoft Intune

Microsoft implemented a new feature to send a Notification either as Push-Notification or as E-Mail to a User when he has newly enrolled a Device in Microsoft Intune. This feature is available for Windows, iOS and Android.

## Configuration
In this post i want to show you how you can setup the enrollment notification. So lets get startet by opening https://endpoint.microsoft.com and switch to the Devices blade. Here you need to open the „Enroll devices“ blade:

If you like, enable Push notifications. The Intune Company Portal will then send a Push notification directly to device when the enrollment has finished. Define a Subject as Title and a Message for the Push notification:
