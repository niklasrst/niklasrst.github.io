# What is Windows Autopatch?

Windows Autopatch is a cloud service that can automatically deploy Windows, Microsoft 365 Apps, Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Teams updates to improve security and productivity in organizations. This service can be configured and used through Microsoft Intune.

### Benefits of Autopatch
_Closing Security Gaps:_ By keeping software up to date, there are fewer security risks and device threats.<br>
_Closing Productivity Gaps:_ Delivering features as they become available gives users new tools to streamline workflows.<br>
_Streamline IT admin resources:_ By automating routine tasks like patching devices, IT admins have more time to implement optimizations.<br>
_Software-as-a-Service:_ By using SAAS, investments in local hardware can be minimized since updates are provided via the cloud.<br>
_Onboarding new services:_ Windows Autopatch is designed to be easy to deploy and minimize patching time.<br>
_Minimizing down times:_ Release in separate update rings optimizes reliability and compatibility for users. User interruptions due to updates are minimized.

## Requirements

### Licenses
Appropriate licensing is required to use the Windows Autopatch Service.

- Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3
- Windows 10/11 Enterprise E5
- Microsoft 365 E3
- Microsoft 365 E5

### Network
To use autopatch, clients must reach the following Microsoft network endpoints: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-autopatch/prepare/windows-autopatch-configure-network

### Operating Systems
Windows Autopatch supports the operating systems Windows 10/11 Pro, Windows 10/11 Enterprise, and Windows 10/11 Pro for Workstations in the 64-bit version.

The clients must all be registered in Corporate-Owned-Personal-Enabled (COPE) mode, Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) is currently not supported!

### Clientmanagement Systems
The cloud service can only be used via Microsoft Intune or Microsoft Configuration Manager.

### Usermanagement
Identities in Azure AD are required for the configuration. Because of this, the user accounts used must be Azure AD or Hybrid Azure AD objects. To be able to activate Windows Autopatch in a tenant, a user with the Azure AD role „Global Administrator“ is required.

### Setup in Microsoft Intune
In this post, we will configure the service to work with Microsoft Intune. Configuration is possible in the Endpoint Manager under „Tenant Administration“:

Here we have to agree to the terms:

The service now checks whether all the requirements are met and reports the status „Ready“ if successful:

## Readiness Status for Windows Autopatch
During the check, the readiness assessment tool reports one of the following 4 messages as a status:

- Ready: No problems, the enrollment can be carried out.
- Advisory: This message requires some steps to be configured. The individual steps are documented in the assessment tool.
- Not ready: There are basic requirements that are not met and must be configured first.
- Error: The Azure Active Directory roles that you have on the user used are not sufficient to carry out the enrollment.

### Activate the Service
If the status is „Ready“, you can start the setup via „Enroll“. There you have to agree to the following conditions again:

In addition, a contact person including a representative must be defined:

The service is now activated for the tenant:

The service is now set up and now we have to create some configurations so that the Autopatch Service can take over the patch management. To do this, we must first add the devices to the Azure AD group created by the service. A click on „Windows Autopatch Device Registration“ opens the group in Azure AD directly:

In the group we then add the computer accounts:

After adding the devices to this group, we need to search for devices in Intune in the Windows Autopatch Service:

It may take up to an hour for the devices to show up here. Once the devices have appeared, you can add them to a distribution group:

- Automatic: Intune automatically creates an assignment on one of the 4 groups.
- Test: This group should be chosen for pilot clients.
- First: This group should be chosen for the first distribution wave.
- Fast: This group should be selected for non-critical clients that can accept downtime.
- Broad: This group can be used for the large mass of devices.

After the assignment, the corresponding group is next to the device:

### Rause or Rollback
The autopatch service makes it possible to pause or stop the rollout of updates and even roll them back later. The „Release Management“ can be used for this after the release of updates.

### Azure AD Groups
The service creates the following groups in the Azure AD tenant:

|Groupname|Description|

|Modern Workplace – Windows 11 Pre-Release|Test Devices	Windows  11  Pre-Releases|
