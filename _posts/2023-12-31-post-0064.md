# Tip on Microsoft licensing

Microsoft employee Aaron Dinnage came up with something to better understand Microsoft’s licenses. For this he created the website https://m365maps.com, where he explains in a simple and understandable way which products are included in which licenses and how the licenses are composed.

For example, if we look at the composition of the Microsoft 365 E5 license, we can see, separated by color, which sub-licenses are bundled in the E5 and which products are licensed under it:

Thanks to this display, it is relatively easy to see which products are licensed in this license and can be used with them. The colored integration represents the license parts in a simple way, from which you can then see which service is licensed via which licenses / add-ons.

For this reason, Aaron Dinnage’s listing at https://m365maps.com is always recommended for most questions about Microsoft licenses.
